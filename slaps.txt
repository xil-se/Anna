a large trout
a slimy toad
a small car
an angry weasel
a problematic customer
an overpriced iPad
a pile of overpriced Windows licenses
an overheated Xbox 360
a bag of frozen peas
a leaky used diaper
his granny's dead cat
a severed leg
a leather whip
a horny dingo
a rubber munchkin
a sewer rat
a stiff chicken
a frozen swordfish
a rotting bamboo pole
a lubricated cucumber
